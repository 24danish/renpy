This file explains how to build the _renpy module for distribution on 
the Mac and Windows.

(This file is not for distribution, as it doesn't make sense to 
 distribute it.)

Windows: 

Get into msys.

cd /t/ab/renpy/module
/c/python23/python setup_win32 build --compiler mingw32 bdist_wininst


Macintosh:

python setup_mac bdist_mpkg --zipdist
