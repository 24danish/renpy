Some notes about making sure things are imported in the proper order:

1) Every module should import 'renpy'.

2) It's okay for modules to 'import renpy.game as game'.

3) Those are all the imports that normal modules should do.

4) renpy/__init__.py should list all the modules in the system, a
   topologically sorted order, such that if a definition in a uses 
   a definition in b, b comes before a. Please note that this only 
   considers the top level of the file.
