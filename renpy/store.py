        @param who_style: The name of the style that is applied to the
        characters name when it is shown to the user.

        @param what_style: The name of the style that is applied to
        the body of the character's dialogue, when it is shown to the
        user.

        @param window_style: The name of the style of the window
        containing all the dialogue.

        @param who_prefix: A prefix that is prepended to the name.
     
        @param who_suffix: A suffix that is appended to the name. (Defaults to ':')

        @param what_prefix: A prefix that is prepended to the text body.

        @param what_suffix: A suffix that is appended to the text body.

        @param function: The function that is called to actually display
        this dialogue. This should either be renpy.display_say, or a function
        with the same signature as it.

        @param predict_function: The function that is called to
        predict the images from this dialogue. It is called with the
        same signature as display_say (although some of the
        parameters, such as what, may be inaccurate), and is expected
        to return a list of displayables that should be loaded.

        @param condition: A string containing a python expression, or
        None. If not None, the condition is evaluated when each line
        of dialogue is said. If it evaluates to False, the dialogue is
        not shown to the user.

        @param interact: If True (the default), then each line said
        through this character causes an interaction. If False, then
        the window is added to the screen, but control immediately
        proceeds. You'll need to call ui.interact yourself to show it.

        @param properties: Additional style properties, that are
        applied to the label containing the character's name.

        @param dynamic: If true, the name is interpreted as a python
        expression, which is evaluated to get the name that will be
        used by the rest of the code.

        @param image: If true, the name is considered to be the name
        of an image, which is rendered in place of the who label.

        @param ctc: If present, this is interpreted as a widget that
        is displayed when all text is shown to the user, prompting the
        user to click to continue. Animation or anim.Blink is a good
        choice for this sort of widget, as is Image.

        @param ctc_position: If "nestled", the ctc widget is
        displayed nestled in with the end of the text. If
        "fixed", the ctc widget is displayed directly on the screen,
        with its various position properties determining where it is
        actually shown.

        @param interact: If True, the default, an interaction will
        take place when the character speaks. Otherwise, no such
        interaction will take place.

        In addition, Character objects also take properties. If a
        property is prefixed with window_, it is applied to the
        window. If prefixed with what_, it is applied to the text
        being spoken. Unprefixed properties are applied to the who
        label, the name of the character speaking.
