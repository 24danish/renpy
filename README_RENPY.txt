Greetings!

You've downloaded a game that was written using Ren'Py, a python based
engine for visual novel style games. If you're interested in making
your own games, you may want to consider downloading Ren'Py from:

     http://www.bishoujo.us/renpy/

Ren'Py games can be played using the keyboard or the mouse.

When dialogue or transitions are displayed, they can be dismissed
by clicking the left mouse button, or pressing space or enter on the
keyboard. When the control key is held down, dialogue and transitions
are rapidly dismissed, provided that the user has seen them
already. Tab toggles skipping mode.

Choices on menus can be made by clicking on the appopriate choice with
the mouse, or by picking the choice using the up and down arrow and
hitting enter.

Hitting escape or clicking the right mouse button brings up the game
menu. This game menu lets you save and load games, quit the game, or
return to the main menu. It also lets you set preferences that control
the behavior of the game. These preferences are:

Display            --- Controls if the game displays in a window or 
                       fullscreen.
Music              --- Controls if music is played or silenced.
TAB and CTRL Skip  --- Chooses if CTRL skips all messages or only messages
                       that have ever been seen on this computer.
Transitions        --- Controls the amount of transitions that are shown.

Finally, Ren'Py supports a rollback feature, which lets you, with some
limits, play the game backwards. For example, you can rollback to a
menu, and save or make a different choice. It also lets you see
dialogue that you missed. You can rollback by pressing the 'page up'
key, or by scrolling your mouse wheel up. Pressing 'page down' or
scrolling your mouse wheel down lets you skip dialogue that's been
seen in this session, which is almost the opposite of rollback.

Thank you for choosing to play a Ren'Py powered game.
