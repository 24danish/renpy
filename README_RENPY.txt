This file contains boilerplate information about running Ren'Py that
can be included into the README for your game. It may be necessary to
change some of the filenames in this document, to make it specific to
your game.

Feel free to use this in your projects.



Running the Game
================

(Windows)

If this game was installed on Windows using an installer, then you can
run it by choosing the shortcut left by the installer. If this game
was installed on Windows using the cross-platform zip file, then it
can be run by executing the run_game.exe file.

(Macintosh)

For information about running Ren'Py games on Mac OS 10.3 or higher,
please go to http://www.bishoujo.us/renpy/mac.html .

(Linux/Unix)

For information about running Ren'Py games under Linux and Unix,
please go to http://www.bishoujo.us/renpy/linux.html . At the very
least, you will need to compile the _renpy module. Read
the file module/README.txt for details.


Playing the Game
================

By default, the game starts running in full screen mode. On some
computers, especially some virtual machines, this can lead to mouse
problems. To fix this, press 'f'.

Some of the more interesting game actions can be performed as follows:

- The left mouse button is used to advance to the next line of
  dialogue, or to pick menu options.

- The right mouse button brings you into a menu screen where you can
  save the game, load the game, change preferences, return to the main
  menu, or quit entirely.

- Scrolling the mouse wheel up or pushing page up returns you to the
  previous screen.

- Holding down the CTRL key skips dialogue. By default, it only
  skips read dialogue, but this can be changed by a preference. Tab
  toggles skip mode.
